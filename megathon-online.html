<h2 class = "center-align">About</h2>

<h5>As part of Megathonâ€™17, we introduced a social challenge which was around Women
	Safety and Cyber Crime. Although it was limited only to Hyderabad students, we were
	really inspired by the innovative solutions that were proposed. Motivated by the success
	last year and a deep desire to take it to national level, we decided to take the same
	problem, which still remains one of the most pressing issues of today.
	<br>
	<br>
	In this edition, we are looking for all kinds of solution (and not just limited to
	technology) that could be useful to address this problem. The whole idea behind this is to
	find solutions that can be implemented and/or taken to the market. Hence, we shall be
	partnering with different govt. agencies (like the Hyderabad Police She Team) and NGOs
	who shall help us in this aspect.
	<br>
	<br>
	We really want to make our small contribution to this important issue and hope for a safer
	nation for women.
