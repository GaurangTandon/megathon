### CSS Documentation - custom classes used
To maintain sanity of code, the custom-bootstrap stylesheet has been organised
so as to maintain modularity in writing. As far as possible, [OOCSS](http://clubmate.fi/oocss-acss-bem-smacss-what-are-they-what-should-i-use/#Object_Oriented_CSS_OOCSS) has been used.

It's been split into the following large categories:
1. CUSTOM DECLARATIONS: contains font-face definitions and other large-changing
modifications in general.
2. BOOTSTRAP CLASS MODIFICATION: Modifications to bootstrap's custom classes to
fit our look and feel.
3. GENERIC CLASSES: Bootstrap-like classes to define styles that can be applied
to generic elements to behave in particular ways. Contains custom colour definitions,
font-stacks, opacity, alignment boxes, and so on.
4. REST: General CSS to (generally) style elements that occur only once
