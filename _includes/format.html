        In this edition, we decided to make Megathon accessible beyond
        Hyderabad to the whole country. For this we are proud to introduce
        to you the Online Round of Megathon, which will help contribute
        ideas for Women Safety. Following this shall continue the 24 hour
        Onsite Hackathon where students prototype and build their business
        model this year as well. We are also bringing Road to Megathon - a
        workshop to help develop technical abilities, and the Business Hack
        where the top ideas will be turned to reality.
