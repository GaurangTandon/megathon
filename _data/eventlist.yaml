  about: >
    As part of Megathonâ€™17, we introduced a social challenge based around Women
    Safety and Cyber Crime. The solutions proposed were innovative and inspiring,
    but limited to primarily Hyderabad students. In this edition of Megathon, we
    decided to make it accessible beyond Hyderabad to the whole country. In this
    regard we are proud to introduce to you the Online Round of Megathon, to help
    contribute ideas for Women's Safety.
